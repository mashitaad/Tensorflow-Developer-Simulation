# Tensorflow-Developer-Simulation

This repository contains code for a TensorFlow Developer Simulation. If you do not see the model `.h5` file included, it is because the file is very large and cannot be uploaded to GitHub directly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Any other required dependencies (see `requirements.txt` if available)

## Running the Code

To run the code, you need to have Python 3 installed. Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python3 nama_file.py
